<h1 style="color:darkblue;text-align:center;">Friends</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">I have lots of friends at my home in South Portland and we always hang out and do fun stuff. Summer is the best time because we have so many things to do whether it is riding our mopeds to the many beaches around us, playing basketball outside with everyone, driving to salmon falls and jumping off the bridge into the river, taking a boat to peaks island, tossing the football around, and just hanging out. </p>
