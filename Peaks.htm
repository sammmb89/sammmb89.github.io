<h1 style="text-align:center;">Peaks Island</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">I lived on Peaks island for the first 4 years of my life and have been going back my whole life. Peaks is an island about 15 minute out of Casco Bay Lines in Portland. Peaks is a beautiful island with a tight community. When my friends and I love to take a boat out there in the summer and visit the beaches and jump of the docks into the oceans. Sometimes we set up a tent and camp out at Battery Steele an old military fort in the middle of the island.</p>
