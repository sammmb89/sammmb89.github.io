<h1 style="color:darkblue;text-align:center;">Sports</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">In high school I loved playing sports. Throughout my 4 years I played Football, Basketball, Track, Baseball, and Lacrosse. My favorite was football. I was a tight end/slot receiver on offense and a defensive end/forward safety on Defense. My Defensive head coach Joe Bailey was a role model who taught me many things and helped me better myself on and off the field.</p>
